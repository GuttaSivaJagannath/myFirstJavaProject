	// Typically it is difficult to choice to make checked exception or unchecked
	// exception.

	// The thing is you need to think about always your Consumer.., What is your
	// Consumer going to do about that exception.

	// if your consumer want to definetly handle the exception, definetly know about
	// the exception, forcing to do a checked exception.

	// But if your consumer cannot do any thing about it, then you typically go for
	// RunTime exception or Unchecked exception.
